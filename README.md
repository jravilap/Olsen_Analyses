# Olsen_Analyses
Analysis for genetic screening and metabolomics identify glial adenosine metabolism as a therapeutic target in Parkinsonâ€™s disease

This project contains the analysis of metabolite abundance measurements obtained with four different liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods of synuclein expressing or control or fly brains in a wilde type or Adk1 knockout background.
